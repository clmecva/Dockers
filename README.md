**Docker**

An open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization technology. Allows developers to package applications and dependencies into standardized units called containers. Containers run consistently across different environments (development, testing, production).


**Docker Architecture**

**Docker Client:**
Interface for users to interact with Docker (CLI or GUI).

**Docker Host:**
Runs the Docker daemon and manages containers, images, networks, and volumes.

**Docker Daemon:**
Background service that manages Docker objects (containers, images, volumes, networks).

**Docker Registry:**
Stores Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).
